#1  how to unfuck corrupted packages that prevent reinstallation or updates
 
    0) Identify corrupted package by attempting to -syu system
       Maybe run reflector to fix your repos first.
    1) Run sed -i 's/PACKAGESGOESHERE //g' Text.txt
    2) sed -i 's/ exists in filesystem//g' Text.txt   gets rid of all unnecessary text.
    3) run tr '\n' ' ' < Text.txt                     spits text out into terminal formatted to rm
    4) run sudo rm -rf TEXTCOPIEDFROMLASTCOMMAND
    5) -syu


#2  Environment Variables
    
    env $VARIABLE=$FLAG as you do
    You can also use unset $VARIABLE to revert

#3  Wine config
    
    Use wine-staging and use dxvk-bin from the AUR
         install dxvk with "setup_dxvk install --symlink" the symlink flag is needed otherwise dxvk wont be updated in the default prefix.

#4  Ntfs drive not mounting

    sudo ntfsfix --clear-dirty /dev/sda1
